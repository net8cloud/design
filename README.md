# net8 design

net8 design is used across all net8 projects. It includes pre-styled `shadcn-svelte` components, fonts, icons and much more.

Feel free to use it in your own projects. Although open-source, the design library comes with some limitations:

- the logo may not be used outside of official net8 projects, these include projects published here:
  - the `net8cloud` GitHub organization
  - the `net8cloud` NPM organization
  - any official net8 website (e.g. `net8.cloud`, `net8.dev`, `net8.work`)
- some dependencies may be restricted by their respective maintainers.
